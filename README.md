## Overview 

### Description

The repo makes use of a custom hook - a useCounter hook for a counter app. It is a project from AltSchool v2 second semester exam. The hook makes use of an increment, decrement, reset, and setValue functions to make the counter app work. 

The project also said to create a 404 page and a page to test error boundary and this project does that. For example, despite the fact that there is a 404 link to a 404 page in the navbar. It also gives the 404 page when a path that is not specified in the routes is added to the root url. You can try it out and see. It also has a dedicated page with an error(a misplelt variable) to test error boundary.
